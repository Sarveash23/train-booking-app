Project Overview (Next.js)
The Train Ticket Booking App is a real-time web application that allows users to book train tickets and select seats. It features first-come, first-served seat-locking to avoid double bookings, with seat statuses (available, locked, booked) visible to all users instantly.

Core Functionalities:

Train Search: Users can search trains by origin, destination, date, and number of passengers.
Real-Time Seat Selection: Users can select seats with real-time updates, ensuring no two users can book the same seat.
Booking Summary and Confirmation: Displays booking details and includes a "Confirm Booking" button to finalize the reservation.
Basic Payment Simulation: Simulates payment confirmation without real transactions.
Detailed Roadmap (Next.js)

1. Initial Setup
Set Up Project Structure:

Create a new Next.js project and set up a single project structure with Next.js handling both the frontend and backend (API routes).
Install Dependencies:

Install necessary packages for database interaction, real-time updates, and environment configuration (e.g., MySQL for database, Socket.IO for real-time functionality, Axios for handling API requests).
Configure Environment Variables:

Create a .env.local file to store sensitive information like database credentials.


2. Database Design and Setup
Create the MySQL Database:

Set up a database named train_booking with tables to store train details, seat details, and bookings.
Define Database Schema:

trains table: Stores train information like train number, departure time, and arrival time.
seats table: Stores information on each seat in a train, including coach number, seat number, and status (available, locked, or booked).
bookings table: Stores booking details for each user, including the seat, train, and fare.
Populate Initial Data:

Insert sample data for trains and seats to facilitate testing and initial setup.


3. Backend Development (Next.js API Routes)
Create API Routes:

Set up API routes in the /pages/api directory for handling backend logic, such as fetching trains, fetching seats, locking seats, and confirming bookings.
Integrate Express with Next.js:

Configure an Express server within the Next.js project to handle real-time functionality using Socket.IO. This will allow Next.js to serve as both the frontend and backend, with the Express server managing WebSocket connections.
Implement Real-Time Updates with Socket.IO:

Set up Socket.IO in the backend to manage seat-locking and booking updates in real time. Ensure that all connected users receive updates whenever a seat’s status changes.
Define Business Logic:

Implement server-side logic to ensure:
A seat can only be locked by one user at a time.
Seat locks expire if not confirmed within a specified timeout, releasing the seat for other users.


4. Frontend Development (Next.js)
Create Pages and Components:

Home Page: Displays a search form for users to find trains.
Train Info Page: Shows available trains based on search criteria, with details like train number and schedule.
Seat Selection Page: Allows users to view and select seats in real time, with locked and booked seats visually differentiated.
Booking Summary Page: Displays selected train and seat details along with fare, and includes a "Confirm Booking" button.
Set Up Real-Time Functionality in the Client:

Configure Socket.IO on the client side to connect with the backend. Listen for events to update seat statuses instantly when other users lock or book seats.
Implement API Calls with Axios:

Use Axios to communicate with Next.js API routes for fetching data, locking seats, and confirming bookings.
Handle API responses and update the UI accordingly.
Set Up the Booking Workflow:

Define the user flow:
Home Page: User searches for a train.
Train Info Page: User selects a train to view available seats.
Seat Selection Page: User chooses a seat, with real-time locking to prevent conflicts.
Booking Summary Page: User reviews and confirms booking details.
Seat Lock Timeout: Implement a feature to automatically release a seat lock if the booking isn’t confirmed within a specific period, and notify other users when a seat is unlocked.
Fake Payment Confirmation:

Add a "Confirm Payment" button to simulate the payment process without actual transactions.
